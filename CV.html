				<H3>Web Developer</H3>
				<H4>Landox</H4>
				<b>March 2016 - May 2016 (3 months) | Bermondsey</b><br/>
				Landox is a fashion start-up company where I was responsible for creating website according to web designer designs and also recommending on softwareâ€™s and hardware. When web designer left the post I was also reasonable to design menswear section, design online magazines, memos and letters. In three months period I helped the company creating 6 websites by now one is released and other are waiting to be released after the company have the stocks to sell their wares.  I used notepad++ to write and test the code, Photoshop was used to design and format the webpage, outlook was used to keep record of the work and one.com was used to deploy the webpage.<br/><br/>

				In this period I learned how to lead a team and working around them, proving advice on software and hardware because not everyone had the programming skills so to solve this issue we would have slightly longer deadline for the first week of the project so other member of the team will not get left behind, have a daily meet-up at the morning before we do anything and provide assistance to one another. Everyone has a disadvantage but working as a team we would cover each other weakness. For example I am not particularly good at design aspect of the website so I pass this role to other member that is good with it and I would focus on programming aspect. Doing this helped us to complete our project more effectively.<br/>
